            The first time that you have a TV in your home, it may be a little nerve-racking getting it set up. There’s a lot to consider: the space where you’re going to put it, whether or not it should go on a wall-mount, and if so, how high off the ground do you want the TV? What about sound? Will you have it amplified, or should you get a soundbar instead?
